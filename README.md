# LIRI
### A command line node app that returns data on songs, concerts, and movies

LIRI stands for Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface, and this app takes its inspiration from iPhone's SIRI software.

The following are LIRI's commands:

spotify-this-song "song name" -- returns a song name, artist(s), album, and a preview link from Spotify

movie-this "movie name" -- returns title, release year, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, country of origin, language, plot, and actors in a movie from OMDb

concert-this "artist name" -- searches for an upcoming concert for a given artist and returns the name of the venue, the venue location, and the date of the show

do-what-it-says -- reads the command written in random.txt and runs said command
